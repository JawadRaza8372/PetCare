        content={`Mr. Ahmed Khan, a compassionate individual with a love for animals, discovered Journey (the name of the pet that was rescued) near the Marriot Hotel. The story began when Mr. Ahmed Khan was in Pakistan on a business tour and was staying at the Marriot Hotel. One day he was walking in front of the Marriott Hotel and the journey was with them, as they reached the corner. The bunch of Grey Hounds attacked them and Journey came in front of them to protect them from the Grey Hounds. They injured the Journey. Mr. Ahmed Khan unable to ignore her difficulty, decided to rescue her, bringing her to the clinic named Royal Pets Hospital. We welcomed Journey with open arms, ready to provide her with the care, she desperately needed. He was so much inspired by the behavior of Journey that he decided to bring her with him to the USA.`}
